# Profile Image Setup

To complete your website setup, please follow these steps:

1. Save your profile photo as `profile-photo.jpg` in the main website directory
2. The image should be:
   - Named exactly: `profile-photo.jpg`
   - Located in: `/Users/mahmoudabdelmoneum/Desktop/Personal_Website/`
   - Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger (square format works best)

Your professional headshot has been integrated into the HTML and CSS. Once you save the image file, it will display perfectly in the About section.

The website is now configured with:
- Your MIT email: mabdel03@mit.edu
- Your affiliation: MIT | EECS, Brain and Cognitive Science, Chemistry, and Biology
- Updated bio reflecting your interdisciplinary work
- Professional contact information

Simply add your image file and your website will be complete!
